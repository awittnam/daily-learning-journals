# LEARNING JOURNAL 20
This is the final entry for 201.  It was an incredible experience working on this final project, both personally and professionally.  I was great to see a project actually start on a white board and have it seven days later being presented to strangers.  There were frustrations along the way but no real issues.  I was quite the learning experience.
