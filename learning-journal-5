# Daily Learning Journal 5

Today there were times when it felt things were coming together.  Then times when it seemed like nothing was working and everything came off the tracks.  I'm starting to grasp concepts but then other items are only understood at a high level.  I'm elevating my emotional IQ and becoming more comfortable being uncomfortable and confused.  I've started taking issued in smaller bite-sized pieces rather than trying to eat the entire elephant at one.   


This was the journal I launched from atom that I couldn't get pushed.
