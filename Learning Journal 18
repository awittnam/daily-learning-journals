Going through the final project has been a lot of fun.  It's been a little nerve wracking when you're adding a feature to an existing framework.  having to go in and make sure variable names are not going to clash or if a variable is related to something else, looking to keep naming conventions the same.  Part of the project collaboration stinks when someone goes a head and builds something over night without letting the team know but, I get it.
